# All About Coffee
 by William H. Ukers, 1922

This project's goals are to help preserve this book and help educate the general public on the history of coffee. Much has changed, yet much remains the same, and there's always plenty of room for improvement.

Special thanks to Project Guttenberg, https://www.gutenberg.org/, for there steadfast efforts to foster open and free ebooks.  The text of this book was cloned from them in hopes to provide a more contemptorary way to generate various output formats.


## Objectives
 - Structure content of book in something like markdown. This should be located in ```src```
 - Create a build to generate outputs in ePub, HTML, PDF, etc.
